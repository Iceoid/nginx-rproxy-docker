# How to install a nginx reverse proxy running in a docker container.
## Prerequisites
    - You need to have ssl wildcard certificates already generated by Letsencrypt for the domain(s) used.
    - The location of those certs are expected to be in /etc/letsencrypt/live/<domain>
    - These certificates should have the appropriate permissions of 600 or 400.
### I made a script (tested only in ubuntu 20.04 for now) for that purpose at https://gitlab.com/iceoid/certbot-wildcard-cloudflare.git

### You might have to give execute permissions to the scripts with
`sudo chmod +x install_docker.sh install.sh`

## Install docker
Run the install_docker.sh script to install docker and docker-compose

## Install a custom reverse proxy
Run the install.sh script.
